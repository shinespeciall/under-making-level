Any Shape Breakable Blocks bundles for WL4 romhack.

You can modify the event id definitions in ASBB.h if the default event indexes have conflict with other patches you are using.
Currently the Sub_806F524_EnemyPanel_Attack.c cannot work for some reason, i don't want to try fixing bugs inside it rn. so just leave it there and let's pretend "Any Shape Breakable Blocks" can only work with Wario. xD.
