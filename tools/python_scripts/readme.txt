I planned to wrote a script for Stable Diffusion to reduce tile for its result at first (ReduceTileUsingSDInpaint.py). then during the time i was fixing bug and writing test logic (ReduceTile_indie.py) for the script. i feel, then test code can work on its own...
a test result of ReduceTile_indie.py can be found in the folder. test_pic_2.png is something generated by Stable Diffusion. test_pic_2_result.png is the result processed by ReduceTile_indie.py. test_pic_2_result_mask.png shows the Tile16s overwrote by other Tile16s.

How to use ReduceTile_indie.py: as long as you have some python3 on your computer, you should know how to pip install stuff by yourself.
How to use ReduceTileUsingSDInpaint.py: IT PERHAPS STILL CANNOT WORK YET. put the script under "stable-diffusion-webui\scripts" then launch stable-diffusion-webui. you need to generate something in the txt2img first, then send the result to inpaint, then you can try to use the script by choose it in the script combobox.

As a result, i think i can just suspend attepting to make the ReduceTileUsingSDInpaint.py work. but it still worth to write down the idea here.

By reading these 2 tutorials, we can partially understand how Stable Diffusion work:
1. https://stable-diffusion-art.com/how-stable-diffusion-work/
2. https://stable-diffusion-art.com/samplers/
According to the ref, we know the inpaint feature of Stable Diffusion can accept an "initial pic", the "mask" and the "text prompt" to change some parts of the "initial pic" and put new things onto it by refering to the "text prompt".
Then here comes the idea: if i slice the "initial pic" into Tile16, then compare the similarity of them using some method, and let a group of similar Tile16s all using the same Tile16. then the "initial pic" will need less Tile16s to build up and can be inserted into old-time console game more easily. now, we mask out all the other Tile16s in the modified "initial pic" who don't have a similar Tile16, then let the Stable Diffusion redraw them. and now, we can do the previous steps again to try find more groups of similar Tile16s and decrease the number of different Tile16s more.

i didn't implement the generation loop in ReduceTileUsingSDInpaint.py since the current logic to compare similarity for every Tile16 are so time consuming, and its complexity is O(tilesize * tilesize * y_tile_count * x_tile_count). it takes much more time to compare Tile16s similarity than process stable diffusion generation logic by one time...
it could be optimized, like writing some pytorch code to palallel similarity calculation, but i don't have a lot of time to do it.
