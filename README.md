This is the repo i use to back up my level data for the Hollow Wario hack based on Wario Land 4.  
I put level(s) which have been fully tested in HW, all WIP levels are in other files, so i can always test things in entry passage, level 1.  
  
  Current progress: finished 1 level in HW, 2 levels WIP.
